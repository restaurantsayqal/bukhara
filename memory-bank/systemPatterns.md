# System Patterns: Bukhara Restaurant Website

## Architecture Overview
The Bukhara Restaurant website follows a standard React Single Page Application (SPA) architecture with component-based UI development and client-side routing.

## Core Design Patterns

### Component Structure
- **Page Components**: High-level components representing full pages (Home, About, Menu)
- **Shared Components**: Reusable UI elements used across multiple pages
- **Layout Components**: Structure elements like Header, Footer, and navigation
- **Feature Components**: Specialized components for specific functionality (reservation form, gallery)

### Data Flow
- **Static Data**: Menu items, restaurant information stored in data files
- **Context API**: Used for shared state management where needed
- **Props Passing**: Component communication through props for isolated functionality
- **Form Handling**: Local state for forms with validation before submission

### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive styling
- **Custom CSS**: Additional styling for specific components where needed
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped styling to prevent conflicts
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for larger screens

## Key Implementation Paths

### Routing
```
App
├── Home (/)
├── About (/about)
├── Menu (/menu)
└── [Future pages]
```

### Component Relationships
```
App
├── Header (Navigation)
├── Page Content (Route-based)
│   ├── Home
│   │   ├── Hero
│   │   ├── FeaturedDishes
│   │   ├── About Summary
│   │   └── Contact/Reservation
│   ├── About
│   │   ├── Story
│   │   ├── Team
│   │   └── Gallery
│   └── Menu
│       ├── Categories
│       └── MenuItems
└── Footer
```

## Performance Optimization
- Image optimization pipeline
- Code splitting for route-based components
- Lazy loading for images and heavy components
- Caching strategies for static content

## Animation and Interaction
- Framer Motion for UI animations
- Intersection Observer for scroll-based animations
- Smooth transitions between pages and UI states

## Future Extension Points
- Authentication system (placeholder exists)
- Online ordering integration
- Newsletter subscription
- Event booking module
